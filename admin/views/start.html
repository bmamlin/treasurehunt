	<h1>You are one of Regenstrief's treasures.</h1>
	<p>Since we're having a treasure hunt, you need to be ready to be found! There are three things you need to learn from this page:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure your QR scanner is working.</li>
		<li>Know what to expect when you scan someone's QR code and how to handle problems.</li>
		<li>Know the no proxies rule</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Starting with this page on your laptop or tablet (not your phone) will make life easier. A shortlink for this page is <a href="http://regen.st/treasure"><b>regen.st/treasure<b></a>.</p>
	<p class="tip">If you log in on someone else's or a public computer, be sure to go to the <a href="#/profile">Profile</a> tab and log out when your done.</p>

	<h2>Make sure your QR scanner is working</h2>

	<p>iPhone users (as of iOS 11) just need to point their camera at a QR code. No additional app is needed.</p>

	<p>If your phone's camera does not recognize QR codes, we recommend you install <a href="http://www.quickmark.com.tw/En/basic/downloadMain.asp"><b>QuickMark</b></a>. Configure your QR scanner to use Safari or Chrome (avoid using an embedded browser).</p>

	<p>Test your QR code reader on this QR code:</p>
	<div class="qr">
		<object data="/api/players/test/qr" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
	</div>
	<p>You should see a green bar at the top and you should be in the list of people found. If you do not see the green bar, make sure you are logged in. You only need to log in once on your phone. If this isn't working for you, contact Burke or Sandy immmediately.</p>
	<p class="tip">If you are using a QR app, configure it to (1) turn off sound and (2) automatically open in your default browser. These settings, combined with temporarily placing the app where you can get to it quickly, will make it easy for you to scan players' QR codes.</p>

	<h2>How the game works</h2>
	<p>Players register at the Regensrief booth and pick up a sheet with all of our pictures and their own, unique QR code on it. Then they try to find each of us and have us scan their QR code. The top 25% of the most successful players will be put in a raffle to win a prize.</p>
	<p>You should expect people to approach you during the meeting asking you to scan their QR code, so <b>please keep your phone with you and charged at all times during AMIA</b>.</p>
	<p>When you scan a code, you should see a green bar and their name on the screen, which gives you the chance to introduce yourself and meet them.</p>

	<h2>No proxies rule</h2>
	<p>Please <b>only scan the QR code for the person in front of you</b>. If someone comes up to you with multiple QR codes or someone else's QR code(s), politely tell them that you are only allowed to scan <em>their</em> QR code.</p>
	<p>The point of this game is to get players to meet you. If you aren't meeting the person, then they're not playing the game.</p>

	<h2>Have fun!</h2>
	<p>If you have any problems, report them to Burke or Sandy.</p>
